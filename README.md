# OnamPookalam
Joy.py is a custom python library so you can't simply import it.  You will have to first of all import it into your machine from GitHub (https://github.com/fossunited/joy/raw/main/joy.py).
Using this joy library I was able to code a pookkalam. This was made for the Code A Pookkalam Event held by TinkerHub.
